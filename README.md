# [WIP] sing-ribet

A tool for convert v2ray URL to sing-box config or vice versa (stupid attempt to make subconverter wannabe but using Rust)

'ribet' is an Indonesian term meaning complicated or impractical. This name was chosen because many users find configuring sing-box to be complicated.

The goal is to enabling everyone, including novice users, to easily set up sing-box configuration.

The configuration generated by sing-rivert is compatible with various sing-box based applications, including:

- sing-box for Android (SFA)
- Box for Root (BFM)
- Nekobox
- husi
